        <p>Help your customer save money with their NHS prescriptions by selling them either a PPC or HRT PPC.</p>
        <h3>The customer can pay a set price for unlimited prescriptions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>PPC: 3 or 12 months certificate</li>
          <li>HRT PPC: 12 months only certificate </li>
        </ul>  
        <h3>Questions and information for the customer, prior to sale</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Check your customer hasn’t previously purchased a PPC before proceeding</li>
          <li>Confirm which PPC is most suitable to the customer</li>
          <li>Let the customer know they are not able to claim a refund for an HRT PPC</li>
          <li>The customer can use their PPC straight away if they start it from today</li>
        </ul> 
        <h3>The cost of a prepayment certificate</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>PPC: £30.25 for 3 months or £108.10 for 12 months</li>
          <li>HRT PPC: £18.70 for 12 months</li>
        </ul>   
        <br>
        <p>After payment, we can send the certificate details to your customer by email, by post – or you can give them the details.</p>
        <p>Tell your customer that they are at risk of receiving a fine if they can not prove their exemption, if asked at a later date.</p>
        <p>If the customer forgets their PCC, refer to the FP57 form to help them.</p>
        <p>We do not send out plastic cards any more as they are costly to the NHS and the environment.</p>
