        <p>Help your customer save money with their NHS prescriptions by selling them either a PPC or HRT PPC.</p>
        <p>A PPC covers all the customer’s NHS prescriptions, an HRT PPC covers only the customer’s HRT prescriptions.</p>
        <p>Customers can use their PPC or HRT PPC straight away, if they start it from today.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A PPC costs £30.25 for 3 months or £108.10 for 12 months</li>
          <li>An HRT PPC costs £18.70 for 12 months (no 3 month option).</li>
        </ul>  
        <p><a href="#">Check here to find out which HRT drugs are covered by the HRT PPC</a></p>
        <h3>Questions and information for customers</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Check which PPC is most suitable for your customer</li>
          <li>Let customers know they are not able to claim a refund for an HRT PPC</li>
          <li>If a customer can't pay for their NHS prescription, you must still provide it to them</li>
          <li>Tell customers that they are at risk of receiving a fine if they can not prove their exemption. Refer to the FP57 form if they’ve forgotten their certificate.</li>
        </ul> 
<br>
        <p>After payment, we can send the certificate details to your customer by email, by post – or you can give them the details.</p>
        <p>We do not send out plastic cards as they are costly to the NHS and the environment.</p>
